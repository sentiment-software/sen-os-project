# Development Environment
## Toolchain
The following toolchain will be needed for the development.
- **NASM**: to compile Assembly
- **Make**: to build
- **QEMU**: to emulate
- **Binary tool**: to view binaries and hex-dumps

Put each tool's binary on the PATH to be able to call it in the terminal and build scripts. <br>
